# ENCE361: Helicopter Rig Controller Project

### By Alvin Li, Matthew Robertson, and Sasiru Goonatilake
### Help from Phil Bones, Ciaran Moore, Le Yang, and ENCE361 tutors

This program controls a remote controlled model helicopter via the UC Remote Labs
The tasks the program performs include:

- Find a direction in which to take-off from
- Rise to an altitude where stable, manoeuvrable flight can be maintained
- Rotate around a fixed position and over several incremental steps
- Land back at base, "parking" in a home position

### Compile

Compile using CCS with Tivaware. OrbitOLED module required
